Hello and thank you for purchasing Low Poly Rally Package.

If models are rendering in pink color?
- Make sure you have connected UniversalRenderPipelineAsset.
- The asset is located in the Settings folder.

There are 70 prefabs.

Models have separate parts for animation.

Texture is 512*512 png

Update 1.2
- Pack updated to Universal Render Pipeline.
- Example Scenes have realtime directional light and baked indirect.
- Fixed issues with the tires.
